/**
 * 1 variable analysis
 * 1 the length of the rod
 * 2 the cut way ! or we can say for one specific cut we get what length !
 * 3 the sheet of the price and length define the max one cut length and you know the cut way choice
 * combine with the reminding length of the rod
 * so we can see these 3 variable affect each other !
 * so we can choose one as the link !
 * so what is the state ?
 * we define the state with some variable so the length and the sheet define the state !
 * just as the paper say ! with the initial input length and the price table .
 * the result is sure !
 * and we study the DP it is the improvement over the normal recursion and the brute enumeration !
 * that is great !
 * here are some problems when the length of the rod <= the sheet definition . we can use the lengthOfRod
 * to do the loop of the recursion but .
 * if the length of the rod > the sheet definition
 * we have to let the length <= the 10 ! ok ! so we just need to do some small adjustment!
 * so in this way we just get the result but we don't get the detail !
 * so how to get the detail !
 * how we exactly do the cut ! ?????
 * we need to do the record ! ?
 * <p>
 * ok actually we are just doing the record work to record the routine of the tree !
 * so how to do that .
 * just with a list
 * why the list because we don't know ! don't know what exactly the length of the you know the
 * routine !
 * do the record maybe not the good way . but we can choose trace it !
 * just as you know the search process . to find the routine !
 * I mean we can use the back trace to just find the
 * you know the result case ! that is really amazing !
