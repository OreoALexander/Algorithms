/**
 *  1 in the custom sort what we do ?
 *    1 for example if we have a class of the student and for one student here are many
 *      attributes and we want to sort the
 *      object according to the you know
 *      one attribute of the student
 *      what should we do ?
 *      1 we use the Arrays sort method
 *      2 we put the array of the student objects into the Arrays.sort() method
 *      3 we should put the custom sort rule into the Array.sort() method so
 *        we can make sure the method do  the sort according to the rule we describe
 *  2 so how to make the custom sort rule ?
 *    1 create a class which implements the Comparator<>
 *    2 put the class of the student into the Comparator<student>
 *    3 override the compare method !
 *    4 in  the compare the input is two student
 *    5 if we want ascend order  ----  a - b
 *      if we need descend order ----  b - a !
